# String Calculator – TDD Kata (Flutter)

This repository contains an implementation of the **String Calculator TDD Kata**
as part of the Incubyte assessment process.

The solution is written in **Flutter (Dart)** and follows a strict
**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach.

---

## Approach

- Followed the **Red → Green → Refactor** cycle
- Wrote unit tests before production code for each requirement
- Committed changes incrementally to demonstrate the evolution of the solution
- Focused on clean, readable, and testable code

Each commit represents a small step in the TDD process.

## Features Implemented

- Returns `0` for an empty string
- Supports single and multiple numbers
- Supports newline (`\n`) as a delimiter
- Supports custom delimiters (`//[delimiter]\n`)
- Throws an exception for negative numbers and lists all negative values
